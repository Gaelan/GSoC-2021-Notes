- Making sure my toolchain works: Compiled virtiofsd-rs and ran a VM talking to it.
  - The interesting bit here is that my primary machine runs macOS, but obviously I need a Linux host for testing. My current solution is to compile and run on an old laptop running Linux, with the source code mounted from my main machine over sshfs. This works well enough, but the old laptop's a little slow (its battery failed and now it won't go above 750 MHz), so if I have time before the coding period starts I'd like to either get cross-compilation working, install Linux on a faster machine, or set up a nested VM on my primary macOS machine. In any case, I've got something that works well enough, so I know I won't get blocked by toolchain issues now.
  - The guest OS isn't too interesting—I really just need a Linux kernel and enough of a userspace to poke at it comfortably. Since I'm using NixOS as the host, I went with its `nixos-rebuild build-vm` command, which gives me a script to launch a fairly lightweight QEMU VM, and lets me pass in any additional parameters I want to give QEMU. This saves me the trouble of creating a disk image and installing Linux on it (but I'll probably end up doing that at some point to test compatibility with other distros).
  - I could read from the virtiofs mount, but not write to it. I'm not too concerned about that—I just wanted to make sure I could compile and run a Rust vhost-user device, and I've done that—but I'll investigate if I have some spare time during the community bonding period.
- Some reading up on the SCSI protocol
  - Found this very helpful introduction: https://www.devever.net/~hl/scsi
